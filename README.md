## 🚀 Get Ready, Set, Code! Getting Started Locally 🏁

Excited to get RepoRover up and running on your local machine? Let's do it!

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js** (LTS version recommended - check `.nvmrc` if available, or aim for v18+)
*   **pnpm** (The project uses pnpm for package management. Installation guide: [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation))

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    First things first, grab a copy of the code:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DUSHIME1212/nextauth5.git 
    cd nextauth5 
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    RepoRover needs some secrets! Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open `.env` and fill in the necessary values:
    *   `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` and `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`: Your GitHub OAuth App credentials. You can create one [here](https://github.com/settings/developers).
        *   Set the callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github` for local development.
    *   `AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for NextAuth.js. Generate a strong one using `openssl rand -hex 32`.
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Should be pre-filled for SQLite: `file:./db.sqlite`.
    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for Google Generative AI. Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Time to fetch all those lovely packages!
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    This command will also automagically run `prisma generate` for you (thanks to the `postinstall` script in `package.json`), getting your Prisma Client ready.

4.  **💾 Database Setup**:
    Let's get that local SQLite database humming:
    *   Ensure you've already copied `.env.example` to `.env` (Step 2).
    *   Ensure you've run `pnpm install` (Step 3).
    *   Now, create the database and apply migrations:
        ```bash
        pnpm run db:generate
        ```
        This command uses `prisma migrate dev` under the hood, which sets up your database schema. Your local database is now ready! 🎉

5.  **Run the Development Server**:
    The moment of truth! Start the app:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. RepoRover should be waiting for you!
